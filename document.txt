# VibeSpace Team-Based Task Manager - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

VibeSpace is a comprehensive team collaboration platform that demonstrates advanced full-stack development skills including:
- Complex relational data modeling
- Role-based access control
- Team-scoped authorization
- Context-aware user interfaces
- Secure authentication flows

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Database Design

**Entity Relationships:**
- User ↔ TeamMember ↔ Team (Many-to-Many with role information)
- User → Task (One-to-Many for created tasks)
- User → Task (One-to-Many for assigned tasks)
- Team → Task (One-to-Many)

**Key Design Choices:**
- Separate TeamMember entity to store role information
- UUID primary keys for security and scalability
- Soft deletes could be implemented for audit trails
- Email verification system for security

### 2. Authorization Strategy

**Team-Scoped Security:**
- All operations verify team membership first
- Role-based permissions within teams
- Guards prevent cross-team data access
- JWT tokens carry user identity, team context determined per request

**Permission Matrix:**
```
Operation           | Admin | Member
--------------------|-------|--------
View team tasks     |   ✓   |   ✓
Create task         |   ✓   |   ✓
Edit any task       |   ✓   |   ✗
Edit own/assigned   |   ✓   |   ✓
Delete any task     |   ✓   |   ✗
Delete own task     |   ✓   |   ✓
Add members         |   ✓   |   ✗
Remove members      |   ✓   |   ✗
```

### 3. Frontend State Management

**Context Architecture:**
- AuthContext: Global authentication state
- TeamContext: Team data and current team selection
- TaskContext: Task operations with team awareness

**Benefits:**
- Centralized state management
- Automatic re-fetching when team context changes
- Consistent error handling across components

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Email verification prevents fake registrations
- Secure token generation for verification

### 2. Authorization Security
- Team membership verified on every operation
- Role-based permissions enforced at API level
- No direct database access from frontend
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

### 3. Data Protection
- Sensitive fields excluded from API responses
- CORS configured for frontend domain
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Database connection pooling for performance

## Performance Optimizations

### Backend
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Eager loading for related entities when needed
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Validation pipes for early request filtering

### Frontend
- React Context prevents prop drilling
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Lazy loading for route components
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependencies

## Error Handling Strategy

### Backend Error Responses
```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "You are not a member of this team",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling
- Global error boundaries for unexpected errors
- Context-level error state management
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for network failures

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for services (business logic)
- Integration tests for controllers
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Mock external dependencies (email service)

### Frontend Testing
- Component unit tests with React Testing Library
- Context provider testing
- User interaction testing
- API integration testing

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Email service configured
- [ ] CORS settings updated
- [ ] Security headers implemented

### Production Considerations
- [ ] Database backup strategy
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] SSL certificates
- [ ] CDN for static assets

This implementation demonstrates enterprise-level development practices with proper separation of concerns, security considerations, and scalable architecture patterns.
